== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many ad blocks can be added to the page? =

The maximum number of ad blocks on the page cannot be more than 3 - https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1346295?hl=en#Ad_limit_per_page.

= Why I cannot choose more than one ad block in the widget tab? =

This limitation is caused by the maximum allowable number of ad blocks to be displayed on the page. Ad blocks display can only be set in the post; in this case, it will not be displayed on the page. However, a widget is usually displayed in every post and every page.

= Ads are not displayed =

1. Please make sure Adblocker (or some other similar extensions that block ads) is disabled in the browser
2. Please make sure that your theme contains the hooks 'the_content' for the ads displaying. The plugin will not work without such hooks.
If you do not know how to do it please install a standard WordPress theme and check if the ads will be displayed or not, if yes it means that there aren't the necessary hooks in your theme.
3. Probably you did not set up 'google ads' account

= What should I do if the plugin is not displayed in the plugins list or the tab with the settings page is not displayed either? =

If you have an extension in your browser that hides ads (e.g. AdBlock or something like that) - it can hide AdSense displaying on this page, as it is set to search by words like AdSense and similar.
Please make sure Adblocker (or some other similar extensions that block ads) is disabled in the browser

= I have some problems with the plugin's work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support? =

Please make sure that the problem hasn't been discussed yet on our forum (<http://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem's description:

1. the link to the page where the problem occurs
2. the name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version - your order number.
3. the version of your WordPress installation
4. copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wi2X8RdRGXk9kMszQy1xItJrpN0ncXgioH935MaBKtc/edit)
